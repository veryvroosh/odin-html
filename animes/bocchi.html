<h1 class="bocchi">BOCCHI THE ROCK!</h1>
<img src ="../images/bocchi.png" alt ="bocchi the rock cover">
<p>Hitori Gotoh, <span class="bocchi"><strong>“Bocchi-chan”</strong></span>, is a girl who’s so introverted and shy around people that she’d always start her conversations with <em>“Ah...”</em></p>

<p>During her middle school years, she started playing the <strong>guitar</strong>, wanting to join a band because she thought it could be an <br>
    opportunity for even someone shy like <em>her</em> to also shine. But because she had no friends, she ended up practicing guitar for <br>
    six hours every day all by herself.</p>

<p>After becoming a skilled guitar player, she uploaded videos of herself playing the guitar to the internet under the name <strong>“Guitar Hero”</strong> <br>
    and fantasized about performing at her school’s cultural festival concert. But not only could she not find any bandmates, before she knew it, <br>
    she was in high school and still wasn’t able to make a <em>single friend!</em></p>

<p>She was really close to becoming a shut-in, but one day, <span id="nijika"><strong>Nijika Ijichi</strong></span>, the drummer in <strong>Kessoku Band</strong>, reached out to her. <br>
    And because of that, her everyday life started to change little by little...</p>
